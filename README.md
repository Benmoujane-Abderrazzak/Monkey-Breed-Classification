# Monkey-Breed-Classification

Welcome to the Monkey Breed Classification Project! This repository hosts a deep learning project focused on accurately classifying different monkey breeds. Leveraging Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), the provided Jupyter notebook outlines the model's architecture, training process, and evaluation metrics. The notebook serves as a comprehensive guide for understanding the intricacies of the implemented deep learning model.

To make the project more accessible and interactive, we've included a user-friendly Streamlit web application in the "Monkey_Breed_APP" folder. With this app, you can easily upload an image of a monkey, and the model will swiftly predict and display the corresponding breed.
